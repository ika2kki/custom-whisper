# custom-whisper

lets you customise the whisper message for https://warframe.market/

only works in firefox.

clicking the extension icon on toolbar will show a little GUI to customise the buy/sell texts.

for example, if you write `hewwo {name}, i want to buy {item} for {cost}p im from warframe.market`,
it will put that text after copying (wont change the text displayed on the website),
replacing anything inside curly brackets with the actual name/item/cost

`/w {name}` is always prepended to the text so you dont need to include it

anyway yea ik the GUI is ugly but it doesnt need to be pretty

i have zero experience with making browser extensions so sorry if anything is wrong...
